# Ethernet for the Macintosh IIsi

This is a design for a PDS Ethernet device for the Macintosh IIsi & other macintoshes with a similar PDS slot. This is not my own design, but a redesign in a different form factor of [the SEthernet/30 for the Macintosh SE/30](https://github.com/rhalkyard/SEthernet). It's meant to be gateware- (for the CPLD), firmware- (the declaration ROM) and software-compatible (the Ethernet driver) with the original.
